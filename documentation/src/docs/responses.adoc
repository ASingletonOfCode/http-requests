=== Handling Responses

`HttpClient` request methods return `HttpResponse` objects that contain information about the response.

==== HttpResponse Properties

The set of response properties is smaller than that of the request, and provides basic information about the response

| Property         | Type          | Description

| `status`         | `Integer`     | HTTP status code of the response.
| `contentType`    | `String`      | Content-Type of the response, if the response contains an entity.
| `charSet`        | `String`      | Character set of the response, if the response contains an entity.
| `inputStream`    | `InputStream` | The `InputStream` object containing the response entity, if there is one.
| `entity`         | `byte[]`      | The response entity as a byte array.
| `headers`        | `Map`         | Response headers.
| `allow`          | `List`        | Contains a list of `HttpMethod` objects. Typically returned from `HTTP OPTIONS`\
                                     requests.

==== Response Entities

By default, the response entity, if available, is read from the `InputStream` into the `entity` property as a byte
array, and the `InputStream` is closed. This effectively makes the input stream unusable. If the request properties
disabled this functionality, the input stream can be read from. However, even when the input stream is not automatically
buffered, the first call to retrieve the entity will read the contents from the input stream and close it.

IMPORTANT: It is very important that authors that use the input stream directly close the input stream when it is no
longer needed. If it is not closed, underlying system resources may not be freed up. The `close()` method can be called
on the `HttpResponse` to close the input stream.

The `HttpResponse` supports entity conversion using the `getEntity(Class<?> type)` method. If an entity reader is
registered that supports the requested type, it will be converted and returned.
