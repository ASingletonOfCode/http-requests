== Changelog

The changelog will be updated with release notes for each release of the library.

=== Version 1
Major version 1 of the library is the first revision of the interface of the `http-requests` library.

==== Version 1.0.1
* Add missing `@DelegatesTo` annotation to a method taking a closure.
* If a retry filter is registered with the client, the request entity is automatically
  buffered so that it can be resent with subsequent requests.
* Add a reference implementation of the client to avoid the need to include other provider
  implementation modules.
* Made the Grails 3.x plugin compatible with JDK 1.7.
* Modify Grails 3.x plugin so that the classpath scanner prefers the non-built-in HttpClientFactory if another
  provider is found.

==== Version 1.0.0
* Initial non-beta release of the library.
